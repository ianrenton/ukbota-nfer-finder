# UKBOTA n-fer finder

Finds multiple bunker activation zone overlaps in the UKBOTA programme. Based on my ["Worked Everything, Everywhere, All at Once" script](https://github.com/ianrenton/weeaaoa), restricted to only a single UKBOTA bunkers CSV, but adds KML export for >=4fers.

4-fers are shown in blue in the KML output and 5-fers are shown in yellow. 

Regions that are a 6-fer or more are shown in red - *please note that the UKBOTA rules do not allow activating more than 5 bunker references at a time*, so if you activate in these areas, you must pick your favourite 5.

Note that the Public Domain licence applies only to the Python code. The UKBOTA bunker data is owned by the UKBOTA programme and subject to its own licence.
